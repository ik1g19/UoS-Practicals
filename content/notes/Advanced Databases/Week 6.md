# Transactions and Concurrency
## Concurrency
### In a multi-user DBMS, many users may use the system concurrently
### Stored data items may be accessed concurrently by user programs
### Transaction↔A logical unit of work that changes the contents of a database
## Serial vs Serialisable
### Serial Transactions↔Transactions running one at a time, with no overlap
### Serialisable Transactions↔Transactions behaving as if they were serial, but may be executed concurrently
### Transactions should be **serialisable** 
## Atomicity
### System failure partway through a transaction may leave the database in an inconsistent state
### Atomic Transactions↔Operations within the transaction are either all executed successfully or not executed at all
## Transaction Problems
### Basic Database Access Operations
#### read(X)→Reads a database item $X_d$ into a program variable $X_T$ in transaction $T$
#### write(X)→Writes the value of program variable $X_T$ in transaction $T$ into the database item $X_d$
### The Lost Update Problem  #Db ↓ 
#### Two transactions have operations interleaved so that some DB items are incorrect
#### ![|400](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/0xJ0zQWiYuTxK70k057DPCr_45QcjNdOEHOK5R_HVvJ8VkEmbq9bxTzRW4YTIMYdLgUJkn_o1eYE5ilv56DPHk3vyb3zgOnQMgHfq_A8KjqzzdsmCuR08vTbtdbBbDVR.png)
### The Temporary Update (Dirty Read) Problem  #Db ↓ 
#### One transaction updates a DB item and then fails, item is accessed before reverting to its original value
#### ![|400](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/_xj32PT1u5jVbu4CDC1RC9QVE4aaXSErqGjYD2q2_iE75arAN4Q5uR3Q3Z-YM8Ncv3ChYFk1ZI0Id8MYYLqaxdFNYfozXre8zcHKjr5VY3gN58rz6trm1YKAgdUPBIhq.png) 
### The Incorrect Summary Problem ↓ 
#### One transaction calculates an aggregate summary function on multiple records while other transactions update records
#### Aggregate function may read some values before they are updated, and some after
#### ![|400](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/pcPGl8nxHrpxhriYHkj7sVZcYJFfjd6pDjg_UaKb4EvL9QYnlAOt-0d5AXO1jImylX0iWlsOq2nOHdhV9mwULpzWO5VTlkrmJq0mj_1azbjdISjVdJZjI36ISpc4Z_CM.png) 
### The Unrepeatable Read Problem  #Db ↓ 
#### One transaction reads an item twice, while another changes the item between the two reads
#### ![|400](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/AFU1LfahEdOPB7x7eBfK1E9HXu3Gxf8rcKGlqlijDPadsbfW8BpAgTpt6bQXe2ipFiyGShdUFx71K-BvYOesejm87STeUIz2y2uCCSZwvB2NvMVwzTTV7gAUnXtcwHKR.png)
## Transaction Processing
### When a transaction is submitted for execution, the system must ensure that ↓ 
#### All operations in the transaction are completed successfully, with effect recorded permanently in the database, or
#### There is no effect on the database or other transactions
### Transactions may be **read-only}} or {{update** 
## Transaction Life Cycle ↓ 
### ![|400](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/mBsOI0E1BMu1PPnYJ9kz8221N6ydydaSSJBOZ9zZnj70WzHFZ6LRnsyCSmWgRdc3Q_t9JJurGL9s0fXUeX-nxG0YmS1V2x5B4oO0gTKktgdi_LamsrVUTBc1PlQfFeml.png)
## ACID
### ACID Properties
#### Atomicity↔A transaction is either performed completely or not at all  #Db
#### Consistency↔Correct transaction execution must take the database from one consistent state to another  #Db
#### Isolation↔A transaction should not make updates externally visible (to other transactions) until committed  #Db
#### Durability↔Once database is changed and committed, changes should not be lost because of failure  #Db
### Schedules
#### A schedule **S** of **n** transactions is **an ordering of the operations of the transactions}}, subject to {{the constraint that for each transaction }}{{**T**}}{{ that participates in }}{{**S**}}, the operations in **T** must {{appear in the same order in }}{{**S**}}{{ that they do in }}{{**T**** 
#### Two operations in a schedule are conflicting if ↓ 
##### They belong to different transactions and
- They access the same data item and
- At least one of the operations is a write()
#### Serial and Serialisable
- A schedule is serial if ↓ 
	- For each transaction **T** in the schedule, all operations in **T** are executed consecutively (no interleaving)
- A schedule **S** of **n** transactions is serialisable if ↓ 
	- It is equivalent to some serial schedule of the same **n** transactions 
#### Schedule Equivalence
- Two schedules are result equivalent if **they produce the same final state on the database** 
- Two schedules are conflict equivalent if **the order of any two conflicting operations is the same in both schedules** 
#### Non-Serial and Non-Serialisable Schedule
- ![|400](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/qN4OQunO6Jih9YMpd4TCNE-mfbtGQOEj5uftKQR_jGrbldRtVJlzY7eUNDkA1SsQ7rkjVwEgS4u02GfKroyC8P73SHuOXZ1rGtNrcxNcLaRhUbYD9M4DSQpFMt9lapr-.png) 
#### Non-Serial but Serialisable Schedule
- ![|400](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/WaAFPrF-sqkYr8h3VNaugDfllkb7_mmgvxihq7xjB1d6LWbX4N0kXGPUy-h6N_LgEVHB7Qp88dGFAysMvvrLJJgtwHwhRHXEWslOi8OQ_J27zxfIUiMPJ8yVffX7C7_R.png) 
## Locking
### Locks are used to synchronise access by concurrent transactions to a database
### Modes
#### Shared→For reading  #Db
#### Exclusive→For writing  #Db
### Lock Operations
#### lock-shared(X)↔Attempt to acquire a shared lock on X
#### lock-exclusive(X)↔Attempt to acquire an exclusive lock on X
#### unlock(X)↔Relinquish all locks on X
### Lock Outcome  #Db ↓ 
#### ![|400](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/SvTjpr85orvCQwLoDnMDurcUE-En2x_Prhpif98imVo9gOy1vIWSfY1-LN9YmpltaZZEsp9GbR2p9DyivkJFvyPKIuvmoTmZg8qoFqoeQ3AcrBrxnq1XPSCoEPD3FswO.png)  
#### The result of an attempt to obtain a lock is either ↓ 
- Grant lock (able to access the item)
- Wait for lock to be granted (not yet able to access item)
- Abort
### Locking Rules
#### Must issue ****lock-shared(X)**}} or {{**lock-exclusive(X)**** before a **read(X)** operation
#### Must issue **lock-exclusive(X)** before a ****write(X)**** operation
#### Must issue **unlock(X)** after all ****read(X)**}} and {{**write(X)**** operations are completed
#### Cannot issue **lock-shared(X)** if **already holding a lock on }}{{**X****  
#### Cannot issue **lock-exclusive(X)** if **already holding a lock on }}{{**X****  
#### Cannot issue **unlock(X)** unless **holding a lock on }}{{**X**** 
### Lock Conversion
#### Rules may be relaxed in order to allow lock conversion
- A **lock-shared(X)** may **be upgraded to a }}{{**lock-exclusive(X)**** 
- A **lock-exclusive(X)** may **be downgraded to a }}{{**lock-shared(X)****
### Locking, by itself, isn't enough for **non-serial** schedules
## Two-Phase Locking (2PL)
### Extra rules for handling locks ↓ 
#### All locking operations precede the first unlock operation in a transaction
#### Locks are only released after a transaction commits or aborts
### Two Phases
#### Guarantees serializable transactions
#### Growing Phase  #Db ↓ 
- Obtain locks 
- Access data items
#### Shrinking Phase  #Db ↓ 
- Release locks
## Deadlock  #Db ↓ 
### When two or more transactions are waiting for each other to release a lock on an item
### ![|400](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/FBCAi_uI6NbuXKo5JekgFD8cM0muFwLiO5Zcz2ZRQFQ8UxSDwBe8BFa8LQDS3gWg16xBF2lCx7vNsdsVgAuzFuUGmgxRdLbfAE2wIAuspXbbFi4Bxk9P2lOgY9tkjFgG.png)  
### Conditions for deadlock to occur ↓ 
#### Concurrency→Two processes claim exclusive control of one resource
#### Hold→One process continues to hold exclusively controlled resources until its need is satisfied
#### Wait→Processes wait in queues for additional resources while holding resources already allocated
#### Mutual dependency
### Dealing with Deadlock
#### Deadlock Prevention ↓ 
- Every transaction locks all items it needs in advance, if an item cannot be obtained , no items are locked
- Transactions updating the same resources are not allowed to execute concurrently
#### Deadlock Detection
- Wait-for graph
	- ![|400](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/rzhWKROsrr_L7POjqyVWPyTgJ7vv8lDYr9_v_tOYViPmqhQux8f0pIbwjXZoOAFv-qBMxVNUE2wP-1QgJntOOhM6LNQkiFV6HuoLHlf6Fnt4hR5e9kS8HixBBL1HKmIF.png) 
		- Representation of **interactions between transactions**   #Db
		- Directed graph containing ↓ 
			- A vertex for each transaction that is currently executing
			- An edge from T1 to T2 if T1 is waiting to lock an item that is currently locked by T2
		- Deadlock exists iff **the Wait-For Graph contains a cycle**   #Db
- Timeouts ↓ 
	- If a transaction waits for a resource for longer than a given period (the timeout), the system assumes that the transaction is deadlocked and aborts it
## Granularity and Concurrency
### Coarser granularity gives **lower** degree of concurrency
### Finer granularity gives **higher** overhead
## Timestamps ↓ 
### Alternative to locks
### Timestamps are **unique identifiers for transactions** 
### TS(T)→Transaction start time
### Each resource **X** has ↓ 
#### A read timestamp ([read-TS(X)](Advanced Databases/Week 6/Transactions and Concurrency/Timestamps/Each resource X has/A read timestamp (read-TS(X))/read-TS(X).md)) 
- **read-TS(X)**↔Set to the most recent timestamp of the most recent read transaction that accessed resource **X** 
#### A write timestamp ([write-TS(X)](Advanced Databases/Week 6/Transactions and Concurrency/Timestamps/Each resource X has/A write timestamp (write-TS(X))/write-TS(X).md))
- **write-TS(X)**↔Set to the most recent timestamp of the most recent write transaction that accessed resource **X** 
### Timestamp Ordering
#### Transactions are ordered based on their **timestamps** 
#### For each resource accessed by conflicting operations, the order in which the resource is accessed must not violate the serialisability order
### Basic Timestamp Ordering ↓ 
#### **TS(T)** is compared with [read-TS(X)](Advanced Databases/Week 6/Transactions and Concurrency/Timestamps/Each resource X has/A read timestamp (read-TS(X))/read-TS(X).md) and [write-TS(X)](Advanced Databases/Week 6/Transactions and Concurrency/Timestamps/Each resource X has/A write timestamp (write-TS(X))/write-TS(X).md) ↓ 
- Has this item been read or written before transaction **T** has had an opportunity to read/write?
- Ensure that timestamp ordering is not violated
#### If timestamp ordering is violated, **transaction is aborted and resubmitted with a new timestamp**
#### **write(X)** ↓ 
- ```bash
if TS(T) >= read-TS(X) and TS(T) >= write-TS(X)
then
#execute write(X)
#set write-TS(X) to TS(T)
else
#abort and rollback T
``` 
#### ![|400](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/fLeHkAUBkoe3Qk8YXQyL2ptla3XAb1XC12Zgn62kZJQ0G0WXFhE-zdHUHKuTVLktm3xvNcvSnVKgZDi65V1VZ6p-J5IkaZp-or6NM1tCWBF2hbfkLg5fScgqOCop-kvf.gif) 
#### **read(X)** ↓ 
- ```bash
if TS(T) >= write-TS(X)
then
#execute read(X)
#set read-TS(X) to max(TS(T), read-TS(X))
else
#abort and rollback T
``` 
#### Dirty Read  ↓ 
- Transaction updates a DB item and then fails
- Item is accessed before reverting to original value
- ![|400](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/Iwnqtiyt2It7ckKadfG1_vUr_ygMSFTjkoQipxtibtcyfaPWSdm5omJluAOKU2e82sxxJiNuf2LmMBGnxc7c1MBr9YG88nDp73DBl3SiJ8bXa7iQ2jWVTnOe9kZagPDx.png)  
	- We can address dirty reads by adding a commit bit **commit(X)** that indicates whether the most recent transaction to write to **X** has been committed
	- **read(X)** for Dirty Read
		- ```bash
if TS(T) >= write-TS(X)
then
#if commit(X) is true
#then
##execute read(X)
##set read-TS(X) to max(TS(T), read-TS(X))
#else
##delay execution until commit(X) is true
else
#abort and rollback T
```
	- **write(X)** for Dirty Read
		- ```bash
if TS(T) >= read-TS(X) and TS(T) >= write-TS(X)
then
#execute write(X)
#set commit(X) to false
#set write-TS(X) to TS(T)
else
#abort and rollback T
``` 
### Thomas' Write Rule ↓ 
#### Modification of Basic Timestamp Ordering that rejects fewer write operations
#### Weakens the checks for **write(X)** so that obsolete write  operations are ignored
#### Does not enforce serialisability
#### Write Rule ↓ 
- ```bash
if TS(T) >= read-TS(X) and TS(T) >= write-TS(X)
then
#execute write(X)
#set commit(X) to false
#set write-TS(X) to TS(T)
else if TS(T) >= read-TS(X) and TS(T) < write-TS(X)
#if commit(X) is true
##ignore write(X)
#else
##delay execution until commit(X) is true
else
#abort and rollback T
### Timestamp Ordering
#### Transactions are ordered based 
## Advanced Transactions
### Flat Transactions ↓ 
#### Basic building block
#### Only one level of control by the application
#### All-or-nothing (Commit or abort)
#### Simplest type
### Long Duration Transactions ↓ 
#### More susceptible to failure (and rollback not acceptable)
#### May lock and access many data items (increases chance of deadlock)
### Savepoints ↓ 
#### An identifiable point in a flat transaction representing a partially consistent state which can be used as an internal restart point for the transaction
#### Used for **deadlock handling** 
#### Savepoints may be persistent ↓ 
- Following a system crash, restart active transactions from their most recent savepoints
#### ![|400](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/5t9sONgpIItjtzfoqkAo8Uc20egEmWQ1YLXrWoBxwMzDQPXxc_NjXmYFWhTAwEB70sgKZCC_LxkbyBd6b1-Va_DdzAVeRnHVHIdlHInUxap-yLteThKAYQnNxz965jTm.png) 
### Chained Transactions ↓ 
#### Transactions broken into sub-transactions which are executed serially
#### On chaining to the next sub-transaction ↓ 
- Commit results
- Keep (some) locks
#### Cannot **rollback to previous sub-transaction** 
#### ![|400](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/2sxIZElIW72NMqIIPWzYGe9vXoT2OcagYOpSF1EkZK1HBdMJyPj_01-Zq4WbxQ2-tOHbZidEqRoxXUPgy9Fd904TCuJ1ehNbKZleHR7B_jUBwb-T7Af2UlDaEJjP56-h.png) 
### Savepoints vs Chained Transactions
#### Both allow **substructure to be imposed on a long-running application program**
- Database context is preserved
- Cursors are kept
#### Commit vs Savepoint
- Chained→Rollback only to previous 'savepoint'
- Savepoints→Can rollback to arbitrary savepoint
#### Locks
- **Chained transactions** free unwanted locks
#### Work Lost
- **Savepoints}} more flexible than {{flat transactions**, as long as the system does crash
#### Restart
- **Chained transactions** can restart from most recent commit, as long as no processing context hidden in local programming variables
#### Both organise **work into a sequence of actions** 
### Nested Transactions ↓ 
#### Transaction forms a hierarchy of sub-transactions
#### Sub-transactions may abort without **aborting their parent transaction** 
#### Rules for Nested Transactions
- Commit Rule ↓ 
	- The commit of a sub-transaction makes the results accessible only to the parent
	- The final commit happens only when all ancestors finally commit
- Rollback Rule ↓ 
	- If any [sub]transaction rolls back, all of its sub-transactions roll back
- Visibility Rule ↓ 
	- Changes made by a sub-transaction are visible to its parent
	- Objects held by a parent can be made accessible to sub-transactions
	- Changes made by a sub-transaction are not visible to its siblings
#### ![|400](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/qQQidx5WRfK2jBGnWi5UjdhsjDF7bLZIIBIcspXJFTnV3_jEkApREXxkmPdB5ZnBE4RjnSJ-ORSj6GNYsRPLGjODOwEzc-dbkhGwJWj7OT1Z4V8nkhB4U2eTL-f4tqml.png) 
#### Observations
- Sub-transactions are not fully equivalent to flat transactions
	- Atomic
	- Consistency preserving
	- Isolated
	- Not durable, because of the commit rule
- Nesting and program modularisation complement each other
	- Well designed module has clean interface and no global variables
	- If it touches the database, the database is a large global variable
	- If the module is protected as a sub-transaction, then database changes are kept clean to
- Nested transactions permit intra-transaction parallelism
### Emulating Nesting with Savepoints
#### ![|400](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/sgKPLJekYxK2zj9Ojhv-6NoaLnJhdC6WPIB-847OHlLt9VTFL7ox3znWesys9WoJw0q32GIFPlPJKCe-yf5Qze1rM6aeB71wTeUftvpMjZ9T70XqG1nGyqpKDiH2iJke.png) 
#### Observations
- Using savepoints is **more}} flexible than nested transactions for internal recovery as {{you can roll back further** 
- True nested transactions are needed in order to run sub-transactions in parallel
	- Emulating with savepoints need 'sub-transactions' to be run in strict sequence
- True nested transactions can pass locks selectively
	- More flexible than savepoints
### Sagas ↓ 
#### A collection of actions (flat transactions) that form a long duration transaction
#### Execution based around notion of compensating transactions ↓ 
- Inverse of actions that allow them to be selectively rolled back
- Used to recover from partial execution
#### Sagas specified as a **digraph**  ↓ 
- Nodes are either actions or the terminal nodes abort and complete
- One node is designated the start
- Paths in graph represent **sequences of actions** 
	- Paths leading to abort are **sequences of actions that cause the overall transaction to be rolled back** 
	- Paths leading to complete are **successful sequences that make persistent changes to the database** 
#### Saga Execution ↓ 
- Each action $A$ has a compensating transaction $A^{-1}$
- Assume if $A$ is an action and $\alpha$ is a sequence of legal actions, then $A\alpha A^{-1}\equiv \alpha$
- If execution of a saga leads to abort, roll back the saga by executing the compensating transactions

## input(X)
### Copy the disk block containing database item  __**X**__  into a buffer frame
### ![|400](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/AZPY0sr8q70o4hQsJyqmiuNn6_Luv3W2JHxX76g376vK9fZFu-h_kd1awYw9cE1tJZ9ZoDDHeTt23iZ9YR4UrgQb1EXJvQtbHQcMB6uuBmU_bRKzo7FDUK4HelORU9cu.png)

### Read a database item  __**X**__  into a local variable
### If the block containing  __**X**__  is not already in a buffer frame, first  __**input(X)**__  
## write(X) 
### ![|400](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/zvpPVfPKmJOfMZtdblUfL-7s2wXNNJr3-V8aYd9KBK38bHF9wmrk4Bvfl_LvmGN2_Yf7w5Kl21paqbAB7J9dMo3Efh-8yO6jx3I_R6XVo4kXwyN_1rpAZsALtw-awiOD.png) 
### Write the value of local variable into database item  __**X**__  in a buffer frame 
## output(X)
### ![|400](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/5d2YKHPGwMhS3jAaKwJH5_upcM9aSIoraGNorisPJwiWEAIIY_LaHthc45g1nacBj6akwP7YA2i1fif0NUgBtBpKBQFkLvmD4UP80qQyeoRmb6IUhsZj7hJrlaIO01jQ.png) 
### Copy the block containing  __**X**__  from buffer frame to disk 
## Logging
### Persistent record of changes made during a transaction 
### Log manager uses **append-only** files to record events
### Log Records
####  __**< start T > **__ →Transaction **T** __** **__ has started execution
####  __**< abort T >**__ →Transaction **T** could not complete successfully, no changes made by **T** will be copied to disk 
####  __**< commit T >**__ →Transaction **T** has completed successfully and will make no further changes to database items
### Undo Logging
#### Repair a database following a system crash by undoing the effects of transactions that were incomplete at the time of the crash
#### Introduces a new record type to record changes
-  __**< T, X, old >**__ →Transaction **T** has changed database item **X** from its old value  
#### Rules 
- U1: If transaction **T** modifies database item **X**, then a log record of the form  __**< T, X, old >**__  must be written to disk before the new value of **X** is output to disk
- U2: If a transaction **T** commits, then its  __**< commit T >**__  log record must be written to disk only after all database items changed by **T** have been output to disk  
#### Example
- ![|400](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/tSAFD2QgnQQW6TGtdyep-bRiN6ysl0gR-hZHoYffKMdD96uYD3setsV1lolag1lMVYAp91x2Uv5VBZLPzbNRdxlwF-47Ar2__uOjpP9ZpcK-ztAEuFL1BWYjrmesZeNg.png)
- X_m is value in memory buffer
- X_d is value in disc 
#### Recovery with Undo Logging 
-  
#### With Checkpointing
- Introduce a periodic checkpoint in the log
	- Only need to search backwards through the log to the most recent checkpoint
	- Before the checkpoint, all transactions have **committed or aborted** 
- Disadvantage of this approach→Must scan the entire log
- New log record type
	-  __**< ckpt >**__ →The database has been checkpointed
- Process ↓ 
######1. Stop accepting new transactions
######2. Wait until all active transactions commit/abort and write  __**< commit T > / < abort T >**__  to the log
######3. Flush log
######4. Write  __**< ckpt >**__  to log
######5. Flush log
######6. Resume accepting transactions
	- ![|400](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/M1KttrN-QJr-1T5Vs6kLxVXpT5ekXu-drXceiF5KIm_pZF2YDd2e_XlxINcUk-vw819tSjueWx4AnuFTgXM796t_eB9AjhTfkdcjthh42feobXY5hdYhkO_Zo2cZct-u.gif) 
- Nonquiescent Checkpointing
	- Need to stop transaction processing while checkpointing
		- Allow new transactions to enter the system during **the checkpoint** 
		- System may appear to **stall** 
	- New log record types
		-  __**< start ckpt (**__ T_1 __**...**__ T_n __**) >  **__ →Checkpoint starts T_1 ... T_n are active transactions that have not yet committed 
		-  __**< end ckpt >**__ →Checkpoint ends
	- Process  #Db ↓ 
#######1. Write  __**< start ckpt (**__ $T_1$ __**...**__ $T_n$ __**) >**__  to log and flush log
#######2. Wait until $T_1$...$T_n$ have all committed or aborted
#######3. Write  __**< end ckpt > **__ to log and flush log

- Recovery with Checkpointed Undo Logging
	- Two cases for recovery depending on latest checkpoint log record
		-  __**< end ckpt >**__  appears latest 
			- ![|400](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/JkL1RusysYRMCumVqdGChlgvzXp-GU9PPYIGW5Nr3aDqwuhOxOiAqN2CVSgo82TSdsJ6nOBpsJ5aTwJo2NJ1PVmsbrhi_M5EsZksjgsktt6PItvjr1B8rM88INl4M-J2.png) 
			- All incomplete transactions began after the previous  __**< start ckpt (...) >**__ 
			- Disregard the log before the previous  __**< start ckpt (...) >**__ 
		-  __**< start ckpt (  **__ T_1...T_n   __**) > **__ appears latest 
			- Disregard the log before the start of the earliest incomplete transaction
			- System crash occurred during checkpoint
			- Incomplete transactions are those encountered after the  __**< start ckpt (...) >**__  and those of T_1...T_n that were not committed before the crash
			- ![|400](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/yfP933fBuewfhDWciSUka2qicExou_n0k3bWFMsUgk4PuJgn3TOu9-9j0PmmZlEBceGNePwMcbBibzJjl61_B7XNr8pIaCMW93zQemBeDH7eYjX30iNx2R7LFCaBQ4-X.png) 
### Redo Logging
#### Write  __**< commit T >**__  log record to disk before changed values are written to disk
#### Issues with Undo Logging 
- If a transaction  __**T**__  commits, then its  __**< commit T > **__ log record must be written to disk only after all database items changed by  __**T**__  have been written to disk
- Potentially causes more disk i/o operations
#### Example
- ![|400](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/6T2yqOOpbuxOxcmHvNQA4KwwHFzox1DFwPr6mWqxlxn7nglPR6X3Cw7BqqR0lS8bgyPHsGKcXVnwVE5kfP1lJHaYQ4ddKchNX_tOLCVPkf4hkLYC1ZSoVH5zllXjF1MP.png)

#### (Non-quiescent) Checkpointing with Redo Logging 
- Recovery with Checkpointed Redo Logging
	- Two cases for recovery depending on latest checkpoint log record
		-  __**< end ckpt > **__ appears latest __** **__

			- Ignore every value written by transactions that committed before the corresponding  __**< start ckpt () >**__  has been written to disk
			- Any transaction named in the checkpoint start, or which has started since, may have changes that have not been written to disk (even if the transaction has committed)
		-  __**< start ckpt (**__ T_1...T_n __**) >**__#
			- Can't tell whether committed transactions to this checkpoint had their changes written to disk
			- Search back to the previous  __**< end ckpt >**__ , find its corresponding  __**< start ckpt () >**__  and treat as [< end ckpt > appears latest   ](Advanced Databases/Week 6/Logging and Recovery/Logging/Redo Logging/(Non-quiescent) Checkpointing with Redo Logging/Recovery with Checkpointed Redo Logging/Two cases for recovery depending on latest checkpoint log record/_ end ckpt _ appears latest.md)

- Write to disk all database items that have been written to buffers but not yet to disk, by transactions that have already committed
- Write log record  __**< end ckpt >**__  and flush log
- Write log record  __**< start ckpt (**__ T_1...T_n  __**) >**__ , where T_1...T_n are uncommitted, and flush log
#### Redo Logging Rule 
- R1: Before modifying a database item  __**X**__  on disk, all log records related to the modification (  __**< T, X, new >**__ ,  __**< commit T  >**__  ) must be written to disk
#### Ignore incomplete transactions, repeat changes made by committed transactions 
#### If no  __**< commit T >**__  record has been written, no changes by  __**T**__  have been written to disk
#### New record type to record changes
-  __**< T, X, new  >**__ →Transaction  __**T**__  has changed database item  __**X**__  to a new value  
### Undo/Redo Logging
#### Undo/Redo Logging Rules
- UR2: A  __**< commit T >**__  record must be flushed to disk as soon as it is written to log 
- UR1: Before transaction  __**T**__  modifies any database item  __**X**__  on disk, the update record  __**< T, X, old, new >**__  must be written to disk
#### Recovery with Undo/Redo Logging→
- Redo all committed transactions from oldest to newest
- Undo all incomplete transactions from newest to oldest

#### Checkpointing with Undo/Redo Logging→
- Write  __**< end ckpt >**__  to log and flush log 
- Write to disk all dirty buffers (i.e. those with one or more changed database items, not just those from committed transactions)
- Write  __**< start ckpt (**__ T_1...T_n __**) >**__  to log and flush log
#### Introduces a new record type to record changes
-  __**< T, X, old, new >**__ →Transaction  __**T**__  has changed database item  __**X**__  from an old value to a new value
#### Aims to address issues with both undo and redo logging
- Undo logging may increase **number of disk i/o operations** 
- Redo logging requires that **all modified blocks be kept in buffers until the transaction commits and the logs flushed**
