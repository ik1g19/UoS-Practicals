    - PSU
    - MCU
    - Coms
    - Power Source
    - I/O
    - Storage
    - Sensors
    - Actuators
    - Switched Mode Regulator
    - Battery
    - Radio Transceiver
    - Flash
- **Hardware Architecture** ↓ 
    - A lot depends on which MCU family is chosen
    - [System on Chip](../Week 2/IoT Architectures/Hardware Architecture/System on Chip is commonly used/System on Chip.md) is commonly used
        - System on Chip↔Has a microcontroller on board and a radio
    - ESP8266 based systems include WiFi and Bluetooth
- **Internet Connected Things**
    - Many systems need a gateway ↓ 
        - Communications hub, border-router or gateways link low power hardware to the outside world
        - Gateway is often more powerful Linux-based hardware
        - Things may not use IP
            - e.g. [LoRaWAN](../../LoRaWAN.md), BTIe 
- **Basic Software Elements** ↓ 
    - OS/Drivers ↓ 
        - Operating System or Bare-Metal
        - Hardware Abstraction Layer
        - Networking
        - Security/Encryption
        - I/O interfaces
        - Sensor drivers
        - Timers, RTC functions
        - Power supply functions
    - Objects ↓ 
        - Object behaviour code
        - Coms/Network Stack
        - Data Storage
        - Power Management
    - Fog/Edge ↓ 
        - Data processing and/or Decision making in the node, border/edge node or Cloud
        - Edge node can be the border to the  main internet and provide data services
        - Cache is common to reduce traffic to the objects
    - Network ↓ 
        - Internet/GSM/communications network
        - Can be IP based
        - Security mechanisms
    - Cloud ↓ 
        - User interface
        - Data storage
        - Data processing/analytics
        - Access mechanisms
- Networks ↓ 
    - WiFi/Ethernet
    - Low Power Wide Area Networks
    - Low Power IPv6 Networks
    - Stars
    - Meshes
- Data Protocols ↓ 
    - Describes the data and mechanisms
        - e.g. RESTfull
    - Systems need to use a data protocol regardless of the type of network
