- Interconnected Smart Home IoT Devices
    - Zigbee maintains a low-power self-{{forming}}, self-{{healing}} {{mesh}} network
    - When a Zigbee device is online, it starts to connect with other Zigbee devices for building a network of related devices
- Smart Home Technology Trends
    - Manufacturers of smart home IoT devices need to ensure their products and services will work on different platforms
    - Smart home technology becomes smarter due to technologies such as machine learning, computer vision and natural language processing
    - In-home healthcare becoming smarter offers potential to reduce stress put on traditional healthcare channels
- Threats and Countermeasures
    - Man-in-the-middle↔An attacker breaches, interrupts or spoofs communications between two systems
    - Data and Identity Theft↔Data generated by unprotected smart appliances provide attackers with personal information that can be exploited
    - Device Hijacking↔The attacker hijacks and assumes control of a device
    - Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)↔Control multiple IoT devices to initiate excessive communication traffic to a target network node, temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to the internet
    - Permanent Denial of Service (PDoS)↔Damaging the device such that it would require replacement of reinstallation of hardware
- Dynamic Electricity Pricing ↓ 
    - Set high prices at peak energy hours to discourage the energy usage there for energy load balancing

- Energy Scheduling for a Smart Home
    - Decisions ↓ 
        - When to launch a home IoT appliance
        - At what power level
        - For how long
        - Utilize renewable energy
        - Subject to scheduling constraints
    - Targets ↓ 
        - Reduce user bill
        - Reduce Peak-to-Average ratio of grid energy usage
        - Maximize renewable energy usage
    - The Smart Home IoT scheduler computes scheduling solutions for the future, meaning it requires the future pricing
        - Pricing Models

                - Guideline Pricing↔Utility publishes it one day ahead to guide customers to schedule their appliances
                - Realtime Pricing↔Utility uses it to bill customers
            - Handling Multiple Users ↓ 
                - Dynamic pricing
                - Game theory
