## (a)
A pollution monitoring sensor system is being designed which can be carried in a backpack or bicycle within a city of 10km diameter. Discuss a networking solution to allow the data to be sent to a server once per day. The sensor data collected is around 6kiB/hour.
Consider the ongoing costs, power requirements and scalability of the system and draw a diagram.
### Answer
- Sensor nodes collect data on inbuilt small non-volatile storage
- Each sensor node will pass data to one of multiple relay nodes using low power radio
- In turn, relay nodes then pass data to a base node using long range communication such as Ultra Narrow Band style SigFox
- Base node can then use sat links to pass data to a server
- Sensor nodes are small low power devices, in addition to low power radio comms, sensor nodes will require a small power draw and will not need regular maintenance
- Power can be improved by having sensor nodes hibernate, sensor nodes are woke by relay nodes when a transfer is required
## (b)
How could you design the system so that the data was sent every minute as it was collected? Assume a sample rate of 100 Bytes every minute. 
### Answer
- LoRaWAN gateways are distributed over the city to cover the diameter
- Sensor nodes communicate with the gateways over LoRaWAN low power wireless
- LoRaWAN gateways can be integrated with The Things Network for real time data monitoring

## (a)
Compare two published sensor networks â€“ one which uses LoraWAN and another which uses 6LowPAN. Discuss the advantages/disadvantages of each networking approach. 
### Answer
- Oxford Flood Network uses LoRaWAN
	- Sensor nodes are small low cost ultrasound sensors to detect water surface
	- Narrow Band wireless is used to link the sensors to a local communications hub
	- Data is aggregated and sent to remote server over TV whitespace
- Mountain Sensing project used 6LowPAN
	- Each node has unique IPv6 address
	- Estate systems GETs data from each node using CoAP
	- Estate then uses an IPv6 tunnel and sat links to communicate to server
- Advantages of Oxford Flood Network
	- More scalable due to LoRaWAN gateways
	- LoRaWAN provides lots of security mechanisms
- Disadvantages of Oxford Flood Network
	- Requires multiple LoRaWAN gateways to be distributed
	- Payload limited to 100 bytes
- Advantages of Mountain Sensing
	- Supports IPv6
	- Provides good integration with the internet
	- Supports mesh networking
- Disadvantages of Mountain Sensing
	- Requires gateway/hub to LANWAN
	- Less immunity to interference
## (b)
Draw two diagrams representing the two deployments.
- Oxford Flood Network
- Mountainsensing

## (c)
Considering one of these two networks, describe an alternative solution for its network.
### Answer
- Mountainsensing could leverage lorawan and TTN integration
- Sensors form clusters around LoRaWAN gateways
- Sensors send data to gateways through LoRa modulation
