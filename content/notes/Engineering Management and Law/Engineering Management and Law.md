## 
# Agile Development
## 
## **Agile Project Management (Scrum)** - Places a premium on flexibility and evolving customer requirements throughout the development process
### Planning the work and then working the plan
### Customer needs may evolve and change over the course of the project
### Importance of evolving customer needs leads to incremental, iterative planning process
## **Unique Features of Agile Project Management**
### Recognizes mistakes of assuming once initial project conceptualization and planning are completed, project will be executed to original specifications
### Emphasis on adaptation, flexibility and coordinated efforts of multiple disciplines
### "Rolling wave" process of continuous plan-execute-evaluate cycle
### Flexible - Iterative system designed for the challenge of managing projects in the midst of change and uncertainty
## **Scrum Process for Project Development**

## **Key Terms in Agile Project Management**
### Sprint↔One iteration of the Agile planning and execution cycle  
### Scrum - The development strategy agreed to by all key members of the project
### Time-box - The length of any particular sprint, fixed in advance, during the Scrum meeting
### User stories - Short explanation of the end user that captures what they do or what they need from the project under development
### Scrum Master - Person on the project team responsible for moving the project forward between iterations, removing impediments, or resolving differences of opinions between major stakeholders
### Sprint backlog - The set of product backlog items selected for the sprint, plus a plan for delivering the sprint goal
### Burndown chart - Remaining work in the sprint backlog
### Product owner - Person representing the stakeholders and serving as the "voice of the customer"
### Development team - Organizational unit responsible for delivering the product at the end of the iteration
### Product backlog - A prioritized list of everything that might be needed in the completed product and the source of requirements for any changes
### Work backlog - Evolving, prioritized queue of business and technical functionality that needs to be developed into a system
## **Stages in a Sprint**
### ![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/PzDZ3ifSau5yDhwspjQunOjq1pu8OwfmXg2l-3y9joYITYJwImB78_G8ctfe731hA4rjmm9T7ja1kFrxrIS2BnAZlDOULXzhI3ynfeVByDkWEtB8vk0enudT9k_QCBJJ.png) 
## **Problems with Agile**
### Active user involvement and close collaboration of the Scrum team are critical throughout the development cycle
### Evolving requirements can lead to potential for scope creep
### It is harder to predict at the beginning of the project what the end product will actually resemble
### Agile requirements are kept to a minimum, which can lead to confusion about the final outcomes
### Testing is integrated throughout the lifecycle which can add cost to the project
### Frequent delivery of project features puts a burden on product owners
### If it is misapplied to traditional projects, it can be an expensive approach without delivering benefits
## Retrospectives→At regular intervals the team stops to reflect on how to become more effective, then tune and adjust behaviour accordingly
## **Reasons to take Retrospectives**##EMLCommon ↓ 
### Identifies needs for improvement
### Builds motivation to change work dynamics
### The best candidate (the team) conducts the retrospectives
### With multiple teams, retrospectives help cross lines to build alliances
### Provides closure from bad experiences that may demoralize
## **Retrospectives in Failed Projects**  #EMLCommon ↓ 
### Provides opportunity to learn from failure
### Helps focus on improvement rather than accusation and blame
### Benefits of learning from experience ↓

# The English Legal System
## Laws - Rules laid down by those in authority
### Flexible
## 
## Categories of Law

### National/Domestic
#### Public
#### Private
### The 2 primary sources of law are Legislation and Case law
## 
## Constitution and Sources of Law
### 3 Branches of power
#### The executive
#### The legislature
#### The judiciary
### In a democracy it is important to have as much separation as possible between these so the rule of law is fair and honourable
#### And that justice is accessible and overt with everyone equal in the eyes of the law
## 
## Hierarchy of the Courts and Tribunals

## 
## The Judiciary
### Role is to adjudicate on the law
### Cannot be sued for decisions made in court but can be investigated regarding procedure of a case before it reaches court
## 
## The Civil Justice System
### Important to follow both substantive and procedural law
### Consider the effect of taking a case to court (litigation) and determine if it is worth it
#### Time
#### Cost
#### Relationships (With suppliers, employer/employees...)
## 
## The Criminal Justice System
### Actions brought by the state
### Severity of the offence will determine where the case is heard and the consequences

# Company Lifecycle
## **What is a Company**
### Most medium sized or larger businesses are companies ↓ 
####1. Companies register at Companies House, which can be searched online
####2. Companies issue shares, each representing a fixed fraction of the firm
####3. Shares in public companies can be bought and sold via a stock exchange
####4. A business might also be a partnership, or a sole trader
####5. Non-profit organisations can register as a charity with the Charity Commission
### Companies must publish their accounts
#### Public companies must provide more detailed accounts than private ones
#### Any member of the public might buy shares based on this information
## Why do firms seek growth→The purpose of a company is to increase the wealth of its shareholders (owners) by paying dividends and/or causing the share price to increase - Friedman (1970)
### As firms move intro new areas work becomes less routine and more interesting
### Employees anticipate opportunities for their own growth (Promotions, better pay, prestige)
### Therefore growing firms find it easier to maintain employee morale
### Larger firms have more influence and power to change the world for the better

#### Engineers and technology change society
#### It is more efficient to do so within an organisation
### Entrepreneurship ↓ 
####1. You have more control
####2. Might raise more funds
####3. Might get rich
### Intrapreneurship ↓ 
####1. Employer funds the work
####2. Less risk for you
####3. Richer pool of talent
####4. You have less control
####5. Lower reward
## 
## **Theories of Growth**
### Gibrat's Law↔Growth of a business occurs in random shocks, there are no systematic determinants of business growth
#### "Firm growth rate is independent of the size at the beginning of the period tested, and the differences are just due to shocks in the system, and therefore the growth in firms is a random process, not depending on firm size or having any correlation over time" - Robert Gibrat, 1931
#### This law seems to hold up better for→Larger firms
#### For smaller firms, size and growth seems to be→Inversely proportional
#### Age also has an effect on growth rate
#### Small and young firms experience more volatile growth rates
#### Gibrat's law is a good approximation or heuristic
### Penrose's Theory of Growth↔Explains sources and hazards of growth
#### Penrose's theory ↓ 
#####1. Resources available to a firm are indivisible and independent
#####2. Firms grow as a result of the efficiency generated through "learning by doing"
#####3. As managers gain more experience, they become more efficient at what they do and take less time to do their tasks
#####4. Freed-up managerial resources then go towards value-creating growth-inducing activities
#### This theory implies that growth is not an end in itself, but rather a→Result
#### Growth hazard: Operating costs ↓ 
#####1. Growth is limited by the amount of managerial attention available at any time
#####2. Too much focus by managers on expansion diverts attention from operational efficiency, thus increasing operational costs
#####3. Hence, above a certain point (optimal growth rate), increases in growth will lead to higher operating costs
#####4. The Penrose Effect→Fast growing firms will thus have higher operating costs then their slower growing counterparts
## 
## **Marris' Theory of Managerial Capitalism** ↓ 
###1. Managers and shareholders decide the management of firms
###2. Managers aim to maximise the growth rate while shareholders aim to maximise dividends and share prices
###3. Managers desire higher growth rate as it enhances their pay, position, status...
###4. To achieve growth, managers therefore seek to retain and re-invest a higher proportion of total profits and expand the firm, driving growth
###5. Reinvesting profit reduces the amount available for paying shareholder dividends
###6. Lower dividends make the shares less attractive, lowering their prices
###7. The threat of take-over reduces management job security
#### To counter this threat→Managers will seek to increase dividend payments
###8. Paying higher dividends limits the resources available for the firm's growth
###9. Managers will therefore choose the growth rate that maximises the price of shares and alo gives satisfactory dividends to shareholders
###10. Shareholders also want balanced growth to ensure fair return on their capital
###11. Thus the goals of managers and shareholder owners are aligned
###12. The result is an optimum rate of growth for the firm

## 
# Traditional and Activity Based  Costing Systems and Procurement
## Overheads
### Overheads are costs required to run a business which cannot be directly attributed to any specific business activity, product or service
### Production overheads include
#### Machine setup
#### Maintenance
#### Storage
#### Handling of goods
#### Wasted materials
#### Testing
#### Faulty items
#### ...
### General business overheads include
#### Accounting fees
#### Advertising
#### Insurance
#### Interest
#### Legal fees
#### Labor burden
#### Rent
#### Repairs
#### Supplies
#### Taxes
#### Telephone bills
#### Travel expenditures
#### Utilities
#### ...
### Financial statements include closing inventory as current assets using the minimum of the cost of production and net realisable value
#### So cost accounting is required for both financial and management accounting
## 
## Cost Allocations and Cost Tracing
### ![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/0qggk_HPtTAYPPG2q-6xA5Udv49nJX99OnvheEJUr8p0OoVmWFWQTXXEUAHg0b1DvSu7eDF6qN8w9AtiFMzNZE7P4rnv9QxhOPEvDBQJ80iSWZcshJBLOz4cSDw2mcSI.png)
## 
## Traditional Cost System
### Quick and cheap to apply, easy to understand
### Shares cost proportionally across all products
### Calculate the total overheads and share this figure proportionally
#### Based on the share of direct labour hours, or a similar cost driver
#### e.g. Assume product A consumes 100k hours/year, and product B consumes 200k
#### If overheads are £900k, allocate £300k of these to product A, £600k to product B
### This system may misallocate costs to higher volume but cheaper products
#### E.g. If product A requires more expensive storage/handling/machinery
#### Waste, faults, machine set up and maintenance costs may also be higher
#### In these cases, product A should be allocated a higher proportion of overheads
#### These days, labour hours/costs are a lower proportion of the total costs
### More accurate costings are needed to improve management decisions
## 
## Activity Based Costing (ABC)
### Finer grained than TCS, potentially more accurate
### Shares cost proportionally based on activity
###1. Identify a number of cost drivers to user, not just labour hours
#### E.g. Machine hours, set up costs, electricity, material storage, handling costs, ...
###2. Determine a metric for each of these to use as a cost driver
### Suppose total labour costs are £6M, and total machine costs are £10.5M
#### Each of these figures now includes all overheads relevant to that category/cost pool
### Product A uses 100k labour hours, 200k machine hours; B uses 200k & 150k
#### So labour costs are £20 per hour, and machine costs are £30k per hour for boths

## 
## Management Decisions and Cost Accounting
### Cost accounting is used in a number of management decisions
#### To determine the minimum pricing of a product or service
#### To support cost engineering (you cannot improve what you do not measure)
#### To make correct decisions about our-sourcing
##### To construct the appropriate portfolio of products or services
#### Activity Based Costing supports Activity Based Management
##### To decide which activities and processes to focus on and improve
### ![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/wXKB263AgtZ1FS7CoL2uiPX4yPqMeLWXCXudFx34GjuRa57jifzUyEYTsE0XlhVrduA0N5CE5DRfza25b8QbZWymn1kQ-w0mt7J_4tR749RgBen4JFdJPQS7giL2Prhp.png) 
## 
## Cost Engineering
### To ensure manufacturing efficiency improves & to manage costs:
#### Cut the number and variety of components required
##### Reduce wastage of raw materials/percentage of faulty items produced
#### Simplify production processes to reduce labour time
#### Share common components between different products or services
#### Buy in sub-assemblies rather than making everything "in-house"
#### Reduce storage and handling overheads by "just-in-time" stock delivery
### Cost engineering can be applied regularly, not just at the start
#### Set annual targets for hains and/or benchmark against the competition
## 
## Manufacturing Learning Curve
### Manufacturing improves with experience
#### Labour efficiency increases as repetition improves working practises
#### Parts, processes and products become more specialised, hence more efficient
#### Better and more automated equipment becomes available
#### Products can be re-designed to become quicker and easier to manufacture
#### Efficiency gains in one area may also be applied elsewhere
### Curtis-Wright (1936) identified this effect in aircraft production
#### Efficiency improved 20% with each doubling of manufacturing volume
##### Boston Consulting Group's Henderson (1973) published the law $C_n = C_1n^{-a}$
#### The efficiency gain is typically in the range 10-25% for each doubling
### Manufacturing experience curve

## The Value Chain
### Sequence of activities which together create a product or service
####1. Inward logistics - Receiving, storing, distributing inputs
####2. Operations - Transforming inputs into a finished item, e.g. manufacturing
####3. Market and Sales - Awareness raising, advertising, sales, sales administration
####4. Distribution - Delivering finished items to the customer
####5. Follow-up Services - Enhancing or maintaining the value of delivered items
### ![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/9fQMgoSArphO8UlnwTGwzOMqgm8pYrgESnQ8VOigsfZCTnychfMzYG5exiuKV_5j4rK0bd3K-Sx2uMP4_aeAI4FHubDVaqsOq9otoV-2tka5zdEydhUwh-x1xk2ArEig.png) 
### The question for the company is, which steps are crucial to the delivery of value, and which are not?
#### To identify the costs of activities to understand whether they add value
#### What cost reductions and process improvements are possible
#### Support activities should boost the effectiveness of primary one
#### What activities can and should be outsourced?
### Outsource only to companies who have competitive advantage
### Monitor outsourcing decisions continuously
## 
## Core Competencies
### Core competency is defined as a harmonized combination of multiple resources and skills that distinguish a firm in the marketplace
#### Makes a significant contribution to perceived customer benefits
#### Should be difficult to imitate, can give access to new markets
#### Drucker claims business has only two functions: marketing and innovation

# Product Evaluation and Customer Insight
## **The Kano Model: Features vs Satisfaction**
### ![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/HiA6cB16uNWwgyn3n1wftmhFV9-ot8eTboTFsXIUiL3gef8gTrUg8eVYb0PT9VxQNygBSZ1gScVfBtyBSNFjCjtNcnU2HQu3-ZHWQfN-H0SZpZzgodL5YXBVjkxXeUtR.png) 
#### As expectations increase, excitement becomes more basic
#### Product Attributes
##### Performance Attributes→Satisfaction increases as more is provided
##### Excitement Features→Unexpected, surprise and delight the customer
##### Basic Attributes→Expected, cause dissatisfaction if not present 
#### Car Example
##### Excitement Needs - New, exciting features
###### e.g. The introduction of central locking or proximity central locking
##### Performance/Linear Needs - The top speed of the car
###### e.g. The greater the top speed of the car, the greater the customer satisfaction
##### Basic Needs - How successfully the car starts
###### e.g. Starting 9 times out of 10 will make the customer dissatisfied, however starting 99,000 times out of 100,000 times would only be considered fine, because it is a basic need
## **The Problem with Customer Needs**
### Customers are unlikely to express either basic or exciting attributes
#### Customers instead focus on→performance attributes and tend to mention needs that are already catered for 
## **The Innovators Dilemma**   
### Staying close to your customers can be fatal
### Satisfying your customers (delivering to your customers needs) can eventually be fatal
### Organizations will reject new ideas because their current customers
#### Did not ask for them
#### Can not currently use them
### Sustaining vs Disruptive Innovation
#### Disruptive 
##### Long term survival
##### Cheaper, lower performance
##### Lower margins
##### Meets customers future needs and establish new markets
#### Sustaining 
##### Evolutionary
##### Improved performance, efficiency and cost
##### Satisfies customer's needs
## **Problems with Traditional Methods**
### Customers are not able to answer direct questions beyond 'performance needs'
### Respondents are unable to articulate complex or emerging issues (tacit knowledge)
### Most customers are unable to identify "breakthrough features"
## **Customer Insight Methods**
### Surveys
#### Give quantitative results
#### Achieving representative samples and adequate response rates are key issues
### Questionnaires
### Focus Groups
#### Limitations 
##### Interpretation - Time consuming and requires experienced analysts
##### Group dynamics can be a challenge
##### Limits generalizability
##### Small number of participants
#### Need careful planning and appropriate analysis
#### Strengths 
##### Concentrated amounts of rich data
##### Interaction of participants adds richness
##### Cost effective
##### Participants guide the discussion
### Ethnography
#### Involves→observation of people using products and services in real situations 
#### Can provide real insight into how people experience product use

## **Market Analysis**
### Using web data
#### Increase sales
#### Drive traffic
#### Target new customers
#### Observe patterns and trends
### Stages of market analysis
#### Industry overview
#### Pricing and forecast
#### Target market
#### Competition
## **Pricing Strategies**
### 5 Common Models
#### **Price bundling**↔Combining products and/or services to increase value, and therefore price
#### **Penetration pricing**↔Setting a price low to enter a competitive market and raising it later 
#### **Competitive pricing**↔Setting a price based on what the competition charges 
#### **Price skimming**↔Setting a high price and lowering it as the market evolves 
#### **Cost-plus pricing**↔Calculating your costs and adding a mark up 
### Issues
#### Psychological Pricing - Looks cheaper, or lucky
##### e.g. £4.99 seems like £4, instead of £5
#### Price is related to demand, in varying ways
- Price Elasticity - The effect of price on quantity
#### Premium Pricing - Price represents value
- e.g. Expensive cars are expensive as it represents the quality of the car

# Law of Agency
## **The Agency Relationship**
### ![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/TmGyMsPnY2r3m9SSjwEc59N1i7vjQwzeLlhF2djGOB3VrtIGKyBd4eKAYVplxIU8fzD_EQMzDiOpbRGSYpC44DAuTdOKMy7l5PLGnxR-gRZEuszO811adLjHE1fubnzI.png) 
## **Creation of Agency**
### Generally agency relationships are easy to establish, and agents derive their authority from
#### An express appointment by the principal (actual authority)
#### An impression of representation conveyed by the principal to a third party (apparent or ostensible authority)
#### An implied appointment by the principal (implied authority)
#### The retrospective acceptance of a contract by the principal (authority by ratification)
#### A situation of emergency (authority through necessity)
## **Creation of Agency**
### Authority through Necessity
#### In such instances, the courts may bind the principal in the actions of the agent given that the following conditions are met
- The agent must have acted in good faith
- The agent's action was necessary, under the circumstances, in order to prevent loss or damage to the principal
- It was not possible for the agent to discuss the issue with the principal and gain their instructions as to the action to be taken
#### An agency may also be established where one party has acted on behalf of another during extraordinary or emergency situations
### Apparent/Ostensible Authority
#### To establish authority, the following criteria must be demonstrated
- There must have been a representation regarding the person as an agent
- The third party must have acted based on this representation
- The principal must have conveyed this representation
#### They authority that an agent possesses may also be apparent. This would be the case where the principal has represented to the third party that the agent has the authority to act on their behalf
#### The agreement concluded between the agent and third party may bind the principal, even if the agent lacked the actual authority
### Implied Authority
#### E.g. A shop owner allows an assistant to order goods on their behalf and habitually pays for them
#### The law can infer the creation of an agency by implication when a person by his words or conduct acts as if he has such authority and the principal acknowledges that he was entitled to act accordingly
#### In such cases, the principal will be bound by the contracts as if they have expressly authorized them
#### The authority of the agent to bind the principal in transactions they may have concluded with third parties can also be assumed or implied by the nature of the relationship
### Actual Authority
#### The agreement should identify the extent of the authority
- i.e. The powers that the agent will have to bind the principal
#### E.g. A shop owner informs the shop assistant that they are allowed to sell the goods in the shop for the price identified on the ticket with no discretion for discounts
#### This can be established verbally or in writing (e.g. through a contract)
#### In most cases, authority is conferred by the principal to the agent through an express agreement
### Authority through Ratification
#### Ratification may be expressed or implied and should meet the following criteria in order to become effective
- It should be given within reasonable time from the agreement and communicated to the party
- The principal must have the capacity to contract (to enter into the contract that the agent actually concluded)
- The principal must be in existence at the time of contracting
- The third party must be aware that a principal exists and the agent acts on their behalf
#### When the principal accepts and confirms such a contract, the acceptance is called ratification
#### An agency by ratification might be created either where
- An agent who was duly appointed has exceeded his authority OR
- A person who has no authority to act acted as if he has the authority
#### In such case the principal can either reject the contract or accept the contract so made
## **Duties of Agents**
### Fiduciary Duty
#### Includes the obligation of the agents
- To avoid placing themselves in a position where their own interest conflicts (or it is possible to conflict) with that of the principal ('no conflict' rule)
- To refrain from disclosing confidential information or documents ('confidentiality' rule)
- To abstain from being involved in situations where they would profit at the expense of the principal ('no profit' rule)
#### It is a commitment of the agent to always act in the best interests of the principal which arises from the confidence and trust that underpin the agency relationship
### Other Duties
#### Other duties imposed on agents include
- The obligation to obey the lawful instructions of the principal
- The obligation to carry the duties assigned to them personally, unless where delegation is expressly allowed by the principal; where delegation is implied by the circumstances of the case; or where it is required by the circumstances of the case
- The obligation to pay the principal all sums received on their behalf maintain proper accounts
- The obligation to carry out their duties with appropriate care and diligence -  based on the nature of the task and the skills they possess
## **Rights of Agents**
### In acting for the principal under the relevant authority, agents have the right to
#### Indemnity - This relates to any liability or costs occurred in the course of their duties unless this is specifically included in the agreement, or the agency authority was exceeded
#### Payment - This can be either the result of an express agreement between the parties (which shall also identify the rate and frequency of the payment) or implied by the parties' conduct and the circumstances
#### Maintain the goods (lien) - This entitled the agent who is owed money by the principal to maintain control over the goods relating to the debt until the latter is satisfied
## **Liability of Agents**
### Contractual Liability
#### Where an agent acts within the scope of their authority, they are not personally liable to third parties on contracts and obligations entered into on behalf of the principal
#### However, a problem arises where the agent acts in excess of the principals authority.
- In that case a distinction should be made between those cases where the agent
	- Has not disclosed that they were acting for a principal
	- Has identified themselves as such
#### The Agent has disclosed the Agency Relationship
- In such cases, the agent and the principal will be jointly liable to the third party
- When the agent discloses the principal to the third party, and the agent was acting under actual authority, liability of the third party to the agent ceases and is transferred to the principal
- The third party may then choose to enforce the contract against the agent or principal, but once the decision is made it cannot be changed
#### The Agent has not disclosed the Principal
- However, the undisclosed principal may assume the obligations arising from such contracts, unless where the third party
	- Specifically asked the agent to identify the principal and they withheld this information or misrepresented the position
	- Would not have agreed to the contract if the principal was disclosed
##### Where an agent has not identified the existence of a principal in the contract with the third party, then the contract will exist between the agent and the third party and the usual rights and liabilities in a contractual agreement will apply
### Tort Liability
#### This connection is established where the wrongful conduct may fairly and properly be regarded as done by the agent in the ordinary course of the principal's business
#### Examples of Vicarious Liability
- An employer will be liable for the leak of lists of personal data by an IT security expert or marketing professional who handle such data for them
- The owner of a delivery company will be liable for a car accident caused by a driver whilst they were delivering packages to clients
#### In those cases where the agent committed a wrongful act which caused harm to a third party, they are held personally liable and must pay damages to the injured person
- Vicarious Liability→The principal may also be 'jointly and severally' liable for the wrongful act of their agent provided that there is a ^^sufficiently close connection^^ between the agents authority and the events that gave rise to liability 
#### The third party is entitled to file a claim of damage against either the agent, the principal or both for the full amount of the suffered loss
#### Vicarious liability arises both for {{intentional }}and {{negligent }}wrongful acts 
#### In case that the principal compensates the third party for all, or part of that loss, they are entitled to seek reimbursement by the agent for any damages they were forced to pay, but for when the principal authorized the wrongful conduct
#### The basis for vicarious liability is sometimes termed the "deep pocket" theory
- The principal (usually a corporation) has deeper pockets than the agent to pay for injuries traceable one way or another to events it set in motion
## **Termination of Agency**
### The agency relationship can be terminated through
#### The mutual agreement of the parties
#### The expiry of its period of validity
#### The accomplishment of the purpose for which it was agreed
#### The revocation or renunciation of the agency agreement
#### The substantial alteration in business circumstances or the value of the subject matter of the agency
#### The bankruptcy, loss of capacity, serious illness or death of the agent or the principal
#### The agency's purpose becoming illegal

# Introduction to Contract Law and Formation
## **Elements of a Contract**
### Agreements - Offer + acceptance
### Consideration - The exchange of promises
### Compliance with required formalities where applicable (e.g. written form or deed)
## **How to conclude whether a contract has been formed**
### Subjective test - Adopt the perspective of the individuals involved in the agreement, to understand what was happening to them
### Objective test - Ignore the particular individuals, instead the adopt the perspective of a  reasonable hypothetical person
## **Smith v Hughes**
### The defendant intended to buy old oats, the plaintiff intended to sell new oats, there was no mention of the type of oats in the contract
## **Bilateral and Unilateral Contracts**
### Bilateral Contracts
#### A contract is formed when these promises are exchanged
#### ![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/jJDfQDO9ymOhjXA7IB9FcaEtkijo3y19cVRAAz8_T3w992MG86GSDrg7nOsH_eFNr5Suck9zdPc66Kf9VcIY4M0ZkqdsH7HdQToogSDGLz10x420V-AZSjEO8t8i2sR8.png) 
#### When moving to the delivery of goods, the buyer and seller swap roles
### Unilateral Contracts
#### E.g. Offering a reward for someone finding a dog, you are not obligated to be a part of the contract, but if you were to try and redeem the reward then you would be a part of the contract
#### One party undertakes to do or refrain from doing something on his part if another party does or refrains from doing something. But the promisee does not himself undertake to do or refrain from doing that thing.
## **Offer and Invitation to Treat**
### Offeror - The person who makes the offer
### Offeree - The person to whom the offer is made

### An offer is an expression of willingness to contract, made with the intention (actual or apparent) that it shall become binding on the person making it as soon as it is accepted by the person to whom it is addressed
## **Offer vs Invitation to Treat**
### Invitation to Treat→Invitation to negotiate  #EMLCommon
### If the initial statement is an offer and the recipient says yes, then we have a contract
### If the initial statement is an [Invitation to Treat](Engineering Management and Law/Introduction to Contract Law and Formation/Offer vs Invitation to Treat/Invitation to Treat.md) and the recipient says yes...
#### then we do not have a contract, but rather the 'yes' is an offer which the initiating party has to accept 
## **Gibson v Manchester City Council (1979)**
### The council had a policy of selling houses to tenants
### The tenant wrote to the council requesting details to buy the house
### The council replied saying it 'may be prepared to sell the house to you' and Gibson completed the application form
### The council changed its policy and Gibson sued the council alleging there was a concluded contract
### The House of Lords disagreed holding that the councils letter was not an offer but an invitation to Gibson to make an offer
#### If the councils reply was considered an invitation to treat, then Gibsons application was the offer, which was never accepted by the council
#### From the councils perspective there was no contract
#### From Gibsons perspective there was a contract
#### If the councils reply was considered an offer then a contract was made when Gibson applied
## **Storer v Manchester City Council (197)**
### Council refused to proceed with the sale as in Gibson v Manchester Council
### However the court of appeal found the contract was concluded because of the language used
#### 'If you will sign the agreement and return it to me, I will send you the agreement on behalf of the [council] in exchange'
## **Partridge v Crittenden (1968)**
### Adverts
### Under the Protection of Birds Act 1954, it was unlawful to offer for sale any wild live bird
### The advert read 'Bramblefinch cocks, Bramblefinch hens 25 s. each'
### Advertisements are invitations to treat
### So the advert was not considered an offer
## **Grainger v Gough (1896)**
### Price lists
### A man was circulating a price list for different wines and their prices
### The transmission of such a price list does not amount to an offer to supply an unlimited quality of the wine described at the price named, so that as soon as an order is given there is a binding contract to supply that quantity
### Reasons for the policy
#### If it were so [i.e. an offer], the merchant might find himself involved in any number of contractual obligations to supply wine of a particular description which he would be quite unable to carry out, his stock of wine of that description being necessarily limited
#### To avoid situations where the seller would be bound to deliver goods which he does not possess
## **Fisher v Bell (1960)**
### Shop windows
### Someone was displaying a flick-knife for sale in the window of a shop
### Potentially a violation of the Restriction of Offensive Weapons Act 1959
### 'I confess that I think most lay people and, indeed, I myself when I first read the papers [proceedings], would be inclined to the view that to say that if a knife was displayed in a window like that with a price attached to it was not offering it for sale was just nonsense'
### But
#### 'It is perfectly clear that according to the ordinary law of contract the display of an article with a price on it in a shop window is merely an invitation to treat. It is in no sense an offer for sale the acceptance of which constitutes a contract'
## **Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain**
### Self-service shops
### The sale of certain drugs was to be supervised by specifically qualified people
#### If the display of the item is an offer the contract is concluded when the customer selected the product from the shelves
#### If the display of an item is an invitation the contract is concluded when the items were paid for
### The court decides the display of an item was an invitation
### 'I think that it is a well-established principle that the mere exposure of goods for sale by a shopkeeper indicates to the public that he is willing to treat but does not amount to an offer to sell'
### ''The customer ... may himself pick up an article and bring it to the shopkeeper with a view to buying it, and if, but only if, the shopkeeper then expresses his willingness to sell, the contract for sale is completed'
### 'The very fact that the supervising pharmacist is at the place where the money has to be paid is an indication to the purchaser that the shopkeeper may not be willing to complete a contract with anybody who may bring the goods to him'
## **Thornton v Shoe Lane Parking (1971)**
### Machines
### 'The customer pays his money and gets a ticket. He cannot refuse it. He cannot get his money back'
### 'He was committed at the very moment when he put his money into the machine. The contract was concluded at that time'
### 'The offer is made when the proprietor of the machine holds it out as being ready to receive the money. The accpetance takes place when the customer puts his money into the slot'
## **Chwee Kin Keong v Digilandmail.com (2004)**
### Websites
### Digilandmail was selling printers on its website for $66
### The official HP website sells the same printer for $3,854
### 4,086 laser printers were ordered
### 'In an internet sale, a prospective purchaser is not a able to view the physical stock available. The web merchant, unless he qualifies his offer appropriately, by making it subject to the availability of stock or some other condition precedent, could be seen as an offer to sell an infinite supply of goods. A prospective purchaser is entitled to rely on the terms of the web advertisement'
### 'It is therefore incumbent on the web merchant to protect himself, as he has both the means to do so and knowledge relating to the availability of any product that is being marketed. As most web merchants have automated software responses, they need to ensure that such automated responses correctly reflect their intentions from an objective perspective'
## **Acceptancce**
### A final and unqualified expression of assent to the terms of an offer

#### Instantaneous - E.g.→phone calls
- Acceptance happens when→the recipient sees the message
#### Non-instantaneous - E.g.→Post
## **Agreement Problems**
### Mistakes
#### Unilateral mistake as to terms
#### Unilateral mistake as to identity
#### Mutual mistake
### Uncertainty
#### Fatal vagueness
- May and Butcher Ltd v The King (1934) [Sale of surplus tentage] 
- No agreement
#### Some vagueness can be overcome
- E.g. If the price is not agreed, but the mechanism of which will determine the price is
- Hillas v Arcos (1932) [Softwood goods]
- Openwork Ltd v Forte (2018)

# Management Accounting and Company Finances
## **Fundamental Accounting Equation** ↓ 
### Assets = Liabilities + Equity
#### Borrowing money to buy a car increases your liability and also your assets
#### Selling shares increases a companys cash and also its shareholder equity
### This equation is maintained by double entry bookkeeping
#### Each transaction is entered at least twice
- Once as a credit and once as a debit, depending on the type of account
#### These must balance, ensuring the new values also satisfy the equation
### ![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/ayX4EawVZ4CIsTCvZraOxd_DmHlnBzpEJLUbNp-HFvqGrKQSlsv4LQ0Y3stOJi7agfJ7vDEOgEdG-jeu-0t48WCRBwG3VNcN2yq4_vP3yuMeNlNXqz1m0cEOvhYe-g4o.png) 
## **Bookkeeping and Company Accounts**
### Companies must maintain accurate accounts
#### To manage their cash flow, keep track of their assets, equities and liabilities
#### Poor bookkeeping can result in unpaid tax, fines and encourages fraud
### Small firms may delegate accounting data entry to a specialist firm
### There are popular packages you can use to enter the data yourself
### As the company grows it usually employs its own specialist staff
## **Two Main Branches of Accounting**
### Financial accounting ↓ 
#### Annual reports of the company's situation
#### These are published to shareholders and the public
#### Must be audited to confirm their correctness
#### Used by investors to decide whether to buy, hold or sell shares
### Management accounting ↓ 
#### Provides additional and more up to date information
#### Typically include data which is company confidential
#### Used to monitor, measure and manage performance
#### And support management decision making
### Plus tax accounting, forensic accounting, accounting information systems...
## **Financial Reports**
### Balance sheet shows→assets, liability and equity at a defined moment  #EMLCommon
### Profit and loss report shows income and expenses
### Equity statement→shows retained earnings  #EMLCommon
### Cash flow statement reports on→operating costs, investing and finances  #EMLCommon
#### These relate to a state period of time, e.g. the reporting year
### Typically also includes a financial review or management discussion
### The report assumes the company is a "going concern"
#### Hence can pay its debts as they fall due - but if not this should be flagged up
#### In case of insolvency, shareholders have lower priority than loan providers
#### Assets usually have lower value if they have to be liquidated (sold off) in a hurry
## **International Financial Reporting Standard**
### Fundamental qualitative characteristics of financial information
#### Relevance
#### Faithful representation
### Enhancing qualitative characteristics
#### Comparability
#### Verifiability
#### Timeliness
#### Understandability
### IFRS standards are required or permitted in over 140 jurisdictions
## **Financial Analysis**
### Before investing in a company, it is wise to analyse their financial data
#### Can access online financial analysis
#### Decide if you will hold your investment and profit through dividends
### As well as the share price, you should look at key financial metrics ↓ 
####1. Market Capitalisation→Share price x Number of shares
####2. Earnings per Share (EPS)→Profit / Number of shares
####3. Price Earnings (PE) Ratio→Profit / Market cap
####4. Beta→A measure of volatility compared to the rest of the market
## **Management Accounting**
### Management Accounting→Analysing information to advise business strategy and drive sustainable business success
### Focusses more on the present and future compared to financial accounting
### Analysis and control of costs, profitability analysis and optimisation
### Claimed to create more value than other types of accounting
### ![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/ZU0mjPJYpER4bgxwezf3U6UeS1vFm3Bmt-XkbpNiKPgqQJByHThdxxKQNwFYBA1waX6qJw4mSpXrw-G_NcxwwUtlE47PF_14OmeRiPqLE671ohvc82I_W9WNzq1G7r8l.png) 
## **Planning and Control**
### Objectives
#### Long term goals
#### Problem - Different stakeholders in organisation may have different goals
### Strategic decisions
#### How to achieve the organisations objectives
#### Strategy involves long-term plans
### Operating decisions
#### How to apply the organisations strategy
#### Operations require short-term plans (budgets)
### These all need to be monitored and controlled
## **Budgeting**
### Involves different levels in an organisation
### Top down approach ↓ 
#### Senior managers tell lower levels what is expected, leave them to work out details
#### Emphasises strategy over operations
### Bottom-up approach ↓ 
#### Lower levels tell senior managers what they can achieve, what resources they need
#### Emphasises operations over strategy
### Participatory approach ↓ 
#### The budget is negotiated between different levels in the organisation
#### May lead to compromises
### ![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/G0vEJAAd4NiegmNmibvjaI_9VmGKrCjy4Fyo4GmjDzVtR00F6LDBw3KEIuRxWl1pgPW74h_4x6ZAWi2RLBd64rttCYH3ynnwSyCZCsTlX5D4uzP-KadRali7sYcoju6n.png) 
## **Costs**
### Avoidable Costs↔Costs that can be eliminated by choosing one alterative over another
#### Avoidable costs are relevant in account terminology
### Unavoidable costs are never relevant and include [Sunk Costs](Engineering Management and Law/Management Accounting and Company Finances/Costs/Unavoidable costs are never relevant and include Sunk Costs/Sunk Costs.md) 
#### Sunk Costs↔A cost that has already been incurred and that cannot be avoided regardless of what a manager decides to do
## **Cost Centres**
### Cost Centre↔An identifiable part of an organisation to which costs can be assigned and aggregated
### In a manufacturing setting, a cost centre could be
#### A single factory
#### A particular department or activity
#### A machine or group of machines
#### An individual or group of individuals
### Cost centres can usually be identified where
#### Many costs can be allocated to specific parts of the organisation
#### Someone has responsibility for that part of the organisation
## **Motivations to measure cost**   ↓ 
### Help in determining the selling price
### Help in production planning
### Maintain management control
### Support management decision making
### Costs can be aggregated by
#### Element (material, labour, ...)
- Useful for cost control
#### Nature (direct, indirect_
- Useful for cost accounting
#### Function (production, non-production)
- Useful for financial accounting
#### Behaviour (fixed, variable, ...)
- Useful for budgeting and decision making
## **Classification of costs**
### Costs vary with activity, they can be ↓ 
#### Fixed 
#![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/2sKlB5sCepb0DDOp9Ab2oZgj6GY9PMggQ25xtSV_wVCgqmBCyxgmPU2syVfgDL1SFFo8bZtGXV51QmYPGmRwQq33pp82UL7aC8f143UqhVsMywAjlqMt9O1bUNQSjhE6.png)  
#### Variable 
#![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/Hb9l5Ht0cjD63_X1jylc0hfIwMRd1WCjwSCvsZuKZ12uYznRIyVx5L1oZ_q0rbbPcqPPpXAUZY9t1WATZS1Li5jnRJ5P58i1zkoD2Hp5Rn7jHeiDp-3lBlBNPGunwML2.png) 
### Costs can also be
#### Semi-variable
#### Semi-fixed
## **Cost Accounting and Profit Model**
### A simple model of a business with just one product is given by ↓ 
#### $\pi = pq - (F + wq)$ 
##### Where ↓ 
######1. $\pi$ is profit
######2. $p$ is sales price
######3. $F$ is fixed costs
######4. $w$ is variable costs per unit sold
######5. $q$ is quantity sold
## **Calculating Direct Costs**
### Suppose a company manufactures tablet computers
#### The required materials total £400
#### The required labour is 5 hours at £20/hour
#### The total direct cost is $£400 + 5 * £20 = £500$
#### The variable cost is $w$
### You need to add a share of the fixed costs to this
#### If $F = £1,500,000$ and $q = 15,000$ then $F/q = £100$
### So the simple model assigns a cost of £600 per unit manufactured
### This tells you what price $p$ to set in order to make a profit
#### Using the model equation re-expressed as $\pi / q = p - w - (F / q)$
#### This is positive if $p > q + (F/q)$
#### If $p = w + (F / q)$ this is called the break-even point
## Kaplan and Norton - The Balanced Scorecard
### Measures that drive performance
#### ![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/wFTsGMW-vXOxpqjOpCvGRxT5ebI51LIxMtfXlQS1AZ5roE5HkEdH6fn7dZwMoF3iJBmqBQit9zoOJoEOxcLke2suszk5BVKxdJsACeVAbBW9gCKeEbfc_qXZ7Y9R58lW.png)  
### Example scorecard
#### ![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/BanPT4b1PkFZQRfANFijewOaMbYPfIVkjd1m_a8fX54W_huW3bKqOhPTs07hK4KKPHgjmOnYECvZsTVNCwX9I3xadn3D-Fxsj9VzwTB7FcvljoR9NPtXASwUO99teNc7.png)
### Ethics and Externalities
#### The balanced score card omits social, environmental & ethical aspects
#### The impact of company strategy and decision making is that making employees redundant affects their families and communities
## **International Transfer Tax**
### Companies traditionally pay tax based on their profits
#### Governments use tax to reduce/correct social and environmental damage
#### By providing social security, effective regulators and financial authorities...
### Global multinational companies transfer profits between countries
#### They end up reporting the profit in a low tax regime, which is tax efficient for them
#### But governments then miss out on tax revenues
### Resolving this issue requires international cooperation

# Business Organisations
## **Forms of Business Organisation**
### Unincorporated - Has no separate legal entity from their participants
#### Partnership
- E.g. Richard and Maurice McDonald
#### Sole Trader
- E.g. Jeff Bezos
### Incorporated - A legal entity in its own right
#### Private Limited Company (Ltd)
- E.g. Dyson Ltd
#### Public Limited Company (Plc)
- E.g. Tesco Plc
#### Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)
- E.g. Ernst & Young LLP
## **Sole Traders**
### Characteristics
#### The simplest business organisation
#### No distinction between the sole trader as an individual and the person running the business
#### Generally perform the work, though they can employ others or subcontractors
#### Entitled to keep all profits after tax
- But have unlimited and personal liabilities to their counterparties and the State for any acts or omissions related to the business
### Formation
#### There are no formal (regulatory) requirements regarding the formation of the sole trader business
#### They may also operate the business in whatever way they wish, as they do not have to ask permission of partners or seek to change the nature of the business that may have been included in a memorandum of association
#### Therefore they may start their trade immediately as long as they are registered with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HRMC)
### Termination
#### Where they cannot pay debts associated with the business, there are formalities to do with bankruptcy proceedings
#### Assuming any tasks undertaken have been completed and creditors have been paid, sole traders only need to inform the relevant authorities of their action to cease trading
#### Few formalities to bring the sole trader business to an end
## **Partnerships**
### Characteristics
#### Partnerships are relations between two or more persons who come together, and act in common to form a business with a view of profit
#### There are four types of partner in a partnership
- 'Typical' Partner→Has the right to take part in the management of the firm 
- 'Silent' Partner→Invests money in the partnership but has no active role in the management
- 'Salaried' Partner→Appears on the firm's letterheads, but does not have the rights and obligations of the other partners 
- Partner 'by estoppel'→Appear as partners of the firm even though they have no active participation in it  #EMLCommon
### Liability of Partners
#### Partners are jointly and severally liable for
- The torts (wrongful acts) committed in the normal course of business
- The firms debts and contracts
#### This means the firms creditors can take action against any partner
- They can also take action against more than one partner at the same time
#### If one partner commits a tort or crime in the course of the business, the partnership will be liable (including each partner) if this was within the offending partner's actual or apparent authority
#### Liability is shared equally between the partners based on their respective percentage of ownership
#### However, if one partner has resources to satisfy the debt and the others do not, the partner with funds is responsible for the full debt. They can then seek the money owed from the defaulting partners
#### Liability cannot be imposed on a partner for acts that occurred before they entered the partnership. However liability continues even when the partner has left the partnership for acts conducted whilst they were a partner
### Formation
#### Partnerships are usually established through a contractually binding agreement ('partnership agreement')
#### The agreement identifies
- The purpose of the partnership
- The time it should remain in existence
- The names of the partners
- The business address
- The percentage of ownership and distribution of profits
- The authority for participating in the management
- The responsibilities of each partner
### Termination
#### According to the Partnership Act 1980, a partnership may be dissolved 
- When a specific task for which the partnership was created has been completed
- On the agreement of the partners
- On the death, bankruptcy, or permanent incapacity of a partner
- Where there has been illegality on behalf of the partnership
- On lapse of time
## **Limited Liability Partnerships**
### Characteristics
#### An LLP is a separate legal entity, with its own legal personality
#### This means that
- The property of the LLP will also belong to the partnership instead of to the partners
- Contracts and obligations will be created with the LLP rather than the individual partners
- The partnership will continue despite changes to its internal membership until formally wound up
### Liability of Partners
#### The 'limited' type of this form of organisation implies that individual partners are only liable up to the value of their participation
#### In case of insolvency, therefore, they will only suffer a loss that equals their investment in the LLP
#### The LLP as a separate legal person remains fully liable for any debts and liabilities ('unlimited' liability)
### Formation
#### The incorporation document and a statement of compliance are filed with Companies house
#### Once all relevant documentation has been received, a certificate of incorporation is issued, which confirms that the partnership exists legally
#### Having received this certificate, the LLP can begin to trade
#### The LLP must notify the Companies House of the individual partners' data and any amendments in its composition
#### Having receieved  
### Termination
#### An LLP can be voluntarily dissolved following an application by the majority of its members
#### LLPs can also be wound up through their insolvency. In that case, procedures may be established for voluntary arrangements, administrative orders, receivership and liquidation
## **Limited Companies**
### Most companies are registered as limited companies, meaning their assets and revenues are separate from the owners' assets and income
### Companies can also register as unlimited companies
### Characteristics
#### Ability to own Property
- The persons who form the company may introduce property to it, either in the form of capital contribution (in exchange for shares) or through a sale agreement
- A limited company has the ability to own property irrespective of the composition of the shareholders
#### Contractual Ability
- Due to their separate legal personality, they may establish contracts and enforce them when the other party is in breach, although a director of the company must physically undertake this
#### Limited Liability
- If there are insufficient funds and assets to pay the creditors, shareholders will be liable for any remaining debts limited to the nominal value of the shares they own ('companies limited by shares'), or the sums guaranteed for that reason ('companies limited by guarantee')
- The most important feature of limited companies
- The company itself has unlimited liability and therefore must satisfy any debts to creditors
- 'limited' refers to the potential liability of shareholders
#### Perceptual Succession
- Once established, they will remain in existence until they are legally wound up, regardless of who owns or runs the company
#### Ability to commit Torts and Criminal Offences
- It is possible for limited companies to commit a criminal offence or tort through their directors
- Directors may also be convicted and imprisoned n the basis of their actions
### Difference between Private and Public Limited
#### A Public Limited Company (PLC) is entitled to offers its shares and debentures for sale to the public and it may be listed on the London Stock Market (although due to the rules in which companies may be listed this is only applicable to the latest organizations)
#### A Private limited company (Ltd) is prohibited from offering its shares to the public. At the same time, though, it has become much less regulated and hence more favourable to those who run businesses than before

### Formation
#### There are three methods for establishing a limited company
- Royal Charter
	- An instrument of incorporation, granted by The Queen, which confers legal personality on an organisation and defines its objectives, constitution and powers to govern its own affairs. This is mainly used for the incorporation of state-run companies, universities etc.
- Registration
	- The most common and simplest way to form a company in the UK
	- The new company will then be noted in the London Gazette
	- The founding members of the company (the 'subscribers') must send the following documents to the Companies House along with the appropriate registration fee
		- The articles of association
		- A completed Form IN01
		- The memorandum of association
	- If the documents are correct, the Register issues a certificate of incorporation, identifying the company with its registered number
- Statute
	- It has been used mainly to create corporations, such as the utilities, where, upon privatization, their status had to be altered as they were no longer owner by the State and did not possess the powers that the State did
### Termination
#### A limited company will only cease to exist when formally wound up
#### There are three main ways for winding up a limited company
- Voluntary liquidation (for solvent companies) - following a resolution of the General Meeting and the filing of a 'Declaration of Solvency' to Companies House
- Application to get the company struck off the Register
- Liquidation by a court (for insolvent companies) - following a petition before the court, provided that the conditions for issuing an order of mandatory liquidation are met

- Possibly, from work rules in work handbooks
- Possibly, incorporated from collective agreements
- Most obviously, in the written statement of terms
#### Written Statement of Terms
- The contract of employment itself need not be in writing, can be informal (agreed orally or implied from conduct)
- But - ERA 1996 s. 1 - employer needs to provide a written statement of the particulars of employment
- Required within 2 months of starting employment
	- Only if you are an employee
- This is not the contract, but is prima facie evidence of its terms

# Decision Making and Investment Appraisal
## Capital Budget Decision Making
### Financial managers are required to determine what long-term investments the business should take on
#### This is called the Captial Budget Decision
### Capital budgeting is also known as Capital Investment Appraisal 
### The objective is to find investments where the returns exceed the cost of capital
### If the firm cannot provide greater returns than safer financial assets, such as government bonds, it should return available funds to its shareholders
#### ![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/IJLvw3u9FA9lalFs_pq6q6kyh5lZVQ6x0tmFngQ_jvmT5NMXlznwB-YXawBAsbA7IgXwW9SIeqKiL9b2YXeI4PYBKl78zshC6G8FEFuSUfhLYsBcb9-JgubosIWZIAxz.png)
- 
## Six Stages in Capital Budgeting
###1. Identification Stage - Identify investments that accomplish organizational objectives and strategies
###2. Search Stage - Explore alternative capital investments that will achieve organizational objectives
###3. Information-Acquisition Stage - Consider the expected costs and benefits of alternative capital investments
###4. Selection Stage - Choose projects for implementation
###5. Financing Stage - Obtain project financing
###6. Implementation and Control Stage - Get projects under way and monitor their performance
- 
## Methods of Evaluating Investment Proposals
### Most popular methods are
#### Methods that ignore the time value of money
- Payback method
##### Accounting Rate of Return (ARR)
#### Methods that take into account the time value of money
##### Net Present Value (NPV)
##### Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
### Money received today is worth more than the same sum received in the future, meaning it has a time dependent value
- 
## Payback Method
### Calculate the number of years before cumulative cash flow equals initial outlay or exceeds it
### Shorter payback periods are better
### Only accepts projects if their payback period is shorter than some defined value
### For non-uniform cash flows
#### Add cash flows period by period until the initial investment is recovered
#### Count the number of periods included for the payback period
### Example
#### Rivers Ltd is considering the development of software to convert its manufacturing processes into computer based ones
#### They have two options available, A and B
#### Evaluate options A and B using the Payback Method
#### Use this to advise Rivers Ltd which investment is better
#### ![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/tWgR4R-LS_hZPQvh0Ik0nsMW_GhrJr7G5EShD-RS7enRKM1mtVyIT6LB0Of1hOLXNp3-urRjirNguU1YNx2ORX4LGSkvYl7GAKiHYOc4WZ21x8c8ig8ygF6JraFUWQ_p.png) 
### Answer
#### ![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/27x1xhxJcuMiGTN6X26PG_ZyIJKzVZbTODTzE9xK6FebPJo1T-mWFoCkHecFA0idptuX1V1wzsFhXnD7X5wqMvVRKexFn7eAdPOlMl4ZON6DdI25GWGlaniZmDMz_DYI.png) 
#### Using the Payback Method
- Option B would be chosen since the payback is at the end of 2 years
- Whereas option A pays back at the end of 3 years
### Evaluating the Payback Method
#### Advantages
- Widely used
- Simple to understand
- Appropriate where liquidity constraints exist and a fast payback is required
- Appropriate for risky investments in uncertain markets
- Often used as an initial screening device
#### Limitations
- Ignores the time value of money
- Ignores cash flows that occur after they payback period
- 
- Accounting Rate of Return (ARR)
### $ARR = \frac{Average Accounting Profit}{Average Investment}$ 
### Accept the project only if its ARR is greater than or equal to the required accounting rate of return
#### If there are mutually exclusive project, accept the one with the highest ARR
### ARR is frequently used to evaluate manager's performance, and is relatively simple to calculate
### ARR ignores the time value of money, however
- 
## Future Value and Present Value
### Future Value - The amount to which an investment is expected to grow after earning interest
### Present Value - The value today of some expected future cash flow
### Calculating Present and Future Values
#### If inflation is 10%, £110 next year is worth the same as £100 now
#### To work out the future value, you multiply by $\frac{100+r}{100}$
- Where  __r__  is the inflation rate as a percentage
- Note that $\frac{100+r}{100}=1+\frac{r}{100}$
- In general, the future value of £ __n__  in  __y __ years time is $n \cdot (1+\frac{r}{100})^y$
- This makes sense if you can find an investment giving  __r __ percent return
#### To work out the present value, you divide by $\frac{100+r}{100}$
- A future sum of £ __n __ is at present worth $\frac{n}{(1+\frac{r}{100})^y}$
- Reducing a sum by a certain amount is called discounting
- 
## Discounted Cash Flows
### Measure all expected future cash inflows and outflows of a project as if they occurred at a single point in time, typically the present
#### They consider the total profitability over the project's anticipated lifetime
#### DCF methods allow for the  __time value of money__ 
#### A pound received today is worth more than a pound received in the future
### DCF methods use the Requires Rate of Return (RRR)
#### This is the minimum acceptable annual rate of return on an investment
- 
## Net Present Value (NPV) Method
### Calculates the expected monetary gain or loss from a project by discounting all expected future cash inflows and outflows to the present point in time, using the Required Rate of Return (RRR)
#### The RRR is determined by the company and the financial situation
#### Allowing for investment risk, inflation, interest rates,...
### Based on financial factors alone, only project with a zero or positive NPV are acceptable
### Three-Step NPV Method
####1. Construct a table of the relevant cash inflows and outflows
####2. Convert the inflows and outflows into present value figures using tables or a calculator
####3. Sum the present value figures to determine the NPV
#### If only one project can be funded, the project with the largest positive NPV is normally selected
### Example
#### SFC Ltd is considering a development of new software that allows a rapid switch between product lines. They have two options available A and B. The IT director has already estimated the likely cost savings
- ![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/ieE6em2PglK5PKmgoGb0WPQ3aA-9zgh2zdY8jYdKLP34VBBVpUcPOTEYY8nPQ8JE27H4esvCm1LHeHIJ9IYjsJOY_KsQ8_ETvq8pYEQphhNoHnH7Js-iHdDqr_LpNLnl.png) 
#### SFC Ltd has a cost of capital (discount rate)  __r__  of 10%
#### Calculate the Net Present Value (NPV) for each option and advise the management of the company which option should be chosen
### Discounted Cash Flows for Option A
#### ![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/MydKwgqYTNbRFJeAfoY96AKF74C3NvQDVMMsy33ebCQVAb44RkxLUnQ-BdsJhXW4B7lWach0WF7HsUHSsgj0SGwOknARyD6dxi3UULjuG1stjDHROlTfDc7j4MqCQxp3.png) 
#### As the Net Present Value is negative, option A should be rejected
### Discounted Cash Flows for Option B
#### ![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/AC33xMDxa7ZJYWSzMAR6-z3oy74l-bSq8yLLAfxSDANJHkWVQal3c3rsTdX2Z7UUcITI_IndmBfO0_V-aMi2nZxPlCl5EpkdW13oviODv0iUNbedjmSM_SG0QHBxF0mD.png) 
#### As the Net Present Value is positive, option B should be accepted
#### The project will yield a DCF return in excess of 10%
- 
## Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
### Represents the discount rate that equates the present value of initial outlay to the present value of the expected cash inflows
#### IRR is the discount rate that equates the NPV of all cash flows to 0
### The IRR method of investment appraisal is broadly equivalent to NPV
### NPV is easier to understand and therefore is usually preferred to IRR

### Invest in your stars
### Keep cash cows going
### Select a few of your question marks to grow
- 
## Multiple Criteria Decision Making/Evaluation
### Most alternatives have a range of attributes or decision criteria
#### The cheapest alternative is rarely the best in all respects
- Comfort
- Durability
- Sustainability
- Attractiveness
- Accessibility
### A Pareto optimal solution is desirable where possible
#### Meaning no adjustment is possible without making some criterion worse
- 
## Evidence Based Decision Making
### Major business decisions are made by a board, committee or panel
#### Diverse groups are known to make better decisions
#### They weigh up the evidence more carefully
#### Due to the voting impossibility theorems of Arrow, Gibbard and Satterthwaite
- There has to be a way to break a voting tie, for example a casting vote
### Outcomes cannot be predicted
#### Researching more data to improve your predictions could take forever
#### So you have to stop at some point and make the decision
### A formal record is usually made of the decision and rationale
#### Helping to defend against later accusations of negligence or legal action
- 
## Using a Decision Matrix to Compare Alternatives
### Counting positive and negative features
#### ![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/X8x8X-g860_06DFAE_M_7Yb0TFUt2-dRApTaeJ1gTux-ffwCQ-kO_uytaCsKmN4l456glSBVpXZ1i_zD-ODVCV-15iN0QcMX4Z2S9RbQWH5JoLAiJ3xHxND39zK_Mxsx.png) 
### Give each attribute or criterion a weight and work out the weighted average or total score
#### ![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/YwmNHQ2TI53oTCFfwuyIsJzydkvdLGqe9G2k6sobhX4q03HKdhs3FHONjVu4mp41V6uNCEHi6FJrMUekmqLCclxc6nr0xCFNuJLcdtCfaFrIT4w6uneZK-2lUEuDOAlT.png)

## Investment Utility, Profit and Cash Flow
### The decision matrix turns multiple criteria into a single one
#### The resulting notion of utility can be optimised more easily
### Choosing an optimal portfolio of projects is also multi-dimensional
### Accountants prefer to use monetary metrics
